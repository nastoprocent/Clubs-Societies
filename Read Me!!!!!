To access the project you need a database. (We stopped using phpmyadmin due to change of plans regarding putting website live.)
Go into bash(terminal) on cloud 9 and type in "mysql-ctl cli"
Find the file "clubsandsocs.sql" in the project.
Open the file, copy everythnig that is in the file.
Paste it into the bash after typing in "mysql-ctl cli"
Database should work right now, try to login.
